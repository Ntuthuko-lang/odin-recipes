    <p class="p">This roasted chicken recipe is the way my grandmother used to make it.<br>
        This method results in the juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked.</p>

    <h2>Roasted Chicken Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>These are the ingredients you'll need to make the juiciest roast chicken recipe of your life:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to
            adjust the recipe.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>
        <li>Butter: Butter (or margarine, if you prefer) locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere
            to.</li>
        <li> Celery: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even
            more moisture as the chicken cooks</li>
    </ul>
